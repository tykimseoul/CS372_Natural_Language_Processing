## NLP HW4 README
* There are three python files: `crawler.py`, `tester.py` and `CS372_HW4_code_20150860.py`. The last one creates the extractor and uses the test script defined in `tester.py`. 
* Run `crawler.py` to crawl PUBMED and search for articles that contain relevant verbs in their abstracts, starting from year 2020. This may take a few hours.
* Required pip modules are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
* The output csv file contains a list of articles and their ids, years, organizations, sentences, triples and the titles.
