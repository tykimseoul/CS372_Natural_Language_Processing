## NLP HW3 README
* Running through the 100 sentences takes around 30 minutes. Please be patient.
* Required pip modules are listed in  the `requirements.txt` file.
* In the output csv file, POS and IPA are added for each heteronym within the sentence, and the citation is at the end.
* Sample sentences in the code are indeed samples; they are not the corpus. Please ignore them.
